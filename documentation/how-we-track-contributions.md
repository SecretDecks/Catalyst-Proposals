# How we track contributions

### Intangibles

[SourceCred](https://www.sourcecred.io) is deployed on our GitHub and is setup to track engagement on Discord and Git(Hub). The engagement generates **CanD** (_SourceCred:_ _Cred_).&#x20;

### Tangibles

All our work is done within or referenced in Git(Hub), that allows for all tangible items to be tracked transparently and on a project or team basis.

### Contribution Survey

The contribution survey is filed by each <mark style="color:purple;">core</mark> contributor once a month. it aggregates tangible contributions and supplements intangibles. Additionally let's the contributor decide how much of their work was done pro-bono or for livelihood. The survey is being improved monthly and the current live version can be found [here](https://github.com/SecretDecks/Documentation/blob/main/.github/ISSUE\_TEMPLATE/Contribution.yml). On the 13th December we migrated over to a YAML template!

### What's to come

* Automation of YAML template (creation, distribution and pre filing)
* Clockify integration!
