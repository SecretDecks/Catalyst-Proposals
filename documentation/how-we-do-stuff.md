# How we do stuff

**For more information on what SeretDecks is **[**click here**](https://secretdecks.gitbook.io/arcana/introduction/who-and-what-is-secretdecks#what-is-secretdecks)****

****[**Short summary**](https://secretdecks.gitbook.io/arcana/introduction/who-and-what-is-secretdecks#what-is-a-disco)** on what a DisCo means to us.**

### **Onboarding & Tiers**

We value everyone's perspective and input. Help us shape SecretDecks in a collaborative and caring environment.

Anyone from lurker to NFT collector, artist or builder - (seriously, just about anyone) can go through the onboarding process. Approved members are rewarded after tasks are done and their contribution is validated by peers. Additionally we use SourceCred to track intangible contributions and reward community care work by distributing a social currency we call Can-D. This currency can be earned by actively engaging in Discord and GitHub. It soon will allow for more voting power and after a certain threshold makes eligible for ADA rewards.

#### Tiers

* <mark style="color:blue;">**Frontgate**</mark> (verified human status but not accepted Mindfulness Policy)
* <mark style="color:green;">**Initiate**</mark> (accepted Mindfulness Policy, community care)
* <mark style="color:purple;">**Core**</mark> (contributor)

#### The <mark style="color:green;">Initiate</mark> onboarding process

* Read and approve the rules on the Discord server.
* Introduce your Self (motivation for being attracted in community, skills, timezone) to any extent you're comfortable with in the&#x20;
* [Pick a role](https://discord.com/channels/839844883124584478/839844883124584480/847795754927652865)
* accept, [discuss](https://github.com/SecretDecks/Documentation/issues/10) or request to amend \[[on Git(Hub)](https://github.com/DanM3rcurius/Documentation/blob/main/Mindfulness-Policy.md)] the [Mindfulness Policy](https://secretdecks.gitbook.io/arcana/introduction/mindfulness-policy)&#x20;
* As an Initiate the mission is to listen, give feedback and care for the community&#x20;

#### The <mark style="color:purple;">Core</mark> onboarding process

* Ask a <mark style="color:purple;">Core</mark> member to join the GitHub Team
* actively participate in Git(Hub) or on GitBook content
* run a sprint
* upon completion of the sprint, the <mark style="color:purple;">Core</mark> votes on approving the new member(s) (75% positive)

#### The participation process

<mark style="color:purple;">Core</mark> members need to attend at least 70% of the events (Town Halls, Plannings, Reviews & Retros).

* not showing to a meeting without an excuse and prior notice at least 90 minutes before the event will result in 1 flag
* a <mark style="color:purple;">Core</mark> contributor looses <mark style="color:purple;">Core</mark> status if 3 flags have been accumulated in one month

All above has been discussed and approved in [this meeting](https://github.com/SecretDecks/Documentation/issues/136)
