# How we remunerate & reward

#### Remuneration of pro bono & livelihood Work

We distinguish between _pro-bono_ and _livelihood_ work. Pro-bono contributions are rewarded with a token of recognition (or an NFT), whereas livelihood work is rewarded with an hourly rate. Each contributor can define how much % of their work is livelihood or pro-bono in their contribution survey each month.&#x20;

#### Contribution Survey (automation in progress)&#x20;

Currently an [issue template](https://github.com/SecretDecks/Documentation/issues/new/choose) in our documentation GitHub repository, that is filled out by <mark style="color:purple;">core</mark> contributors each month. Once filled, each survey has to acquire at least one peer approval. This is done by @ mentioning the peer that can confirm what the contributor has worked on.

#### Rewarding Community Care Work

Interactions on our communication and coordination platforms (Discord and GitHub) is being tracked by [SourceCred](https://sourcecred.io), an OpenSource engagement tracker for self organising communities. More on that on the [next page](how-we-track-contributions.md). The engagement is visualised as a social currency we coined _Can-D._ Anyone that joins is accruing Can-D when interacting with one another.&#x20;

Anyone that has accrued more than **78 Can-D** by end of November is eligible for an ADA airdrop! We'll evenly distribute about **234 ADA** (13% of our funded contributions) to everyone on or above the **78 Can-D** threshold.&#x20;

This threshold and amount of ADA can and should be changed if need be (for example if sentiment tests show negative scores).  The goal is to keep engagement high. How much it shall be changed will be voted upon by the <mark style="color:purple;">core</mark> and <mark style="color:green;">initiates</mark> (with different voting weight).&#x20;
