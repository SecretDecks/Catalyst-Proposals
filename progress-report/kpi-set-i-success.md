# KPI set I (success)

**Sentiment Analysis**

* Leading KPI: Create & Distribute 1 sentiment poll per month
* Lagging KPI: have SourCecred running and distribute Cred, take a sentiment vote on how much the community feels the distribution is fair; vote should be 75% (or more?) positive
* **Future** leading KPI: Create GitBook chapter with sentiment poll template

### Lagging KPI

SourceCred is running and aggregating since May 21, as can be seen [here in the explorer](https://secretdecks.github.io/SCinstance/#/explorer).

The sentiment survey concluded the Community tips were seen as fair. The Remunerations to core contributors were not too clear, for the data set couldn't be found easily. We fixed this during the survey by making the link to the data set more prominent.
