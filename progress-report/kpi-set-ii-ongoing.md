# KPI Set II (ongoing)

**Adoption**

* Leading KPI: setup 1 SC instances per month including on-boarding workshop
* Lagging KPI: 1 organisation per month is adopting SC without asking for help after the workshop

### Leading KPI

Currently setting up SourceCred on the [HardForq](https://github.com/The-HardForq/SC-Instance). Since our Admin left the team in November, one of the founders is looking into the setup, as the technical skills are not yet developed this can take a couple more days.

### Lagging KPI

Workshop still TBD
