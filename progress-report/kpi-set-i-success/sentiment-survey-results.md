# Sentiment Survey Results

## Work Reward Sentiment Analysis

**Participants:** 7

### Question no. 1

How do you feel about the distinction between Remunerations and Tips?

#### Answer

average of 3.43 of 5 possible

**Feedback to consider**

Tips are associated with optional payments in the service industry. **Should we rename tips to something else to remove the service industry allusion?**

**Positive Statements**

> I think creating the distinction and rewarding intangible contributions is very beneficial towards the overall health of community driven projects. I think we have an opportunity to improve how the distinction is communicated to those unfamiliar with DisCo's.

#### Summary

* **action needs to be taken soon!** Rework communication (terminology!) and what non financial rewards actually are besides NFTs

**To Do**

* [ ] **define non financial rewards!!**

### Question no. 2

Looking at the Remuneration calculation and distribution, do you think it's fair?

#### Answer

mixed; 3 yes, 3 not sure, 1 no

**Positive Statements**

> I appreciate the fact that care-work and other intangible contributions are acknowledged at a more quantifiable level. I believe that by doing this, it may inspire more members to contribute this 'energetic glue' that often holds communities together. Within the status quo, these actions are given verbal kudos at best, incentivising people to focus their energy on tangible impact

#### Summary

* **action needs to be taken now!** The distinction is not clear to all; often because the dataset (link to github issues) is missing but still needs to be communicated better

#### To Do

* [x] Make links in question more clear

### Question no. 3

Looking at the Tip calculation and distribution, do you feel that you and everyone else in the community has been rewarded evenly and fairly?

#### Answer

average 4 of 5 total

**Feedback to consider**

\-> I think it's fair and only assume that most receiving 29.14 ADA and some 29.13 is a division thing **Should we round down the tips to an even amount to cover for varying transaction fees?**



\-> I intuitively think it is fair, but find it difficult to find the data that backs this up. I know that it exists, but it may be hard to find for a new community member. **Where should the dataset links be displayed?**

**Positive Statements**

> Fair because those are clearly the most active members.

> The amount was more of a felt sense of fairness. The process of distribution was transparent and easy to see. That's good!

#### Summary

* **No urgent action needed** Was clear and fair if link to dataset has been found; have to make link more prominent;

**To Do**

* [ ] discuss with cooperative where best place(s) for link to data set is!
