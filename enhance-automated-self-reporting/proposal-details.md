# Proposal Details

### **Revisiting the Problem Statement**

_Self reporting is **difficult** albeit most **important** in distributed organisations. Current tools make it tedious to do correct self auditing._

#### Why difficult?

Since there is no one "pulling" reports from contributors in a distributed (heterachical) organisation, each person is responsible for reporting to them selfs and "push" them the cooperative as a whole.  &#x20;

Assessing intangibles - is highly experimental, and best practices are still being established

Taking time - to document what one has been working on and aggregate it&#x20;

Standardised processes - are missing and need to be piloted & tested within different communities

Tooling is missing - or is proprietary, sometimes spread across different platforms.

#### Why important?

**Rewards & Remunerations** - self reporting allows for calculating (post) remuneration and rewards of pro bono and livelihood work.

**Accountability & Reputation** - are easily built; by offering an "impact trail" of what roles and tasks have been taken on (accountability) and what value was created by successfully delivering (reputation).

**Transparency** - everyone can see at a glimpse what someone else has been working on the last 4 weeks.



&#x20;\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Revisiting the Solution**

_A contribution survey automatically generated and populated with the contributions done in all Git repositories._

#### What's a contribution survey?

It's a document in GitHub (called "issue") that is being raised at the end of the month, for each member. The purpose of this survey is to document all contributions (tangible & intangible) done within a month. Until now every core contributor of SecretDecks is manually filing this report ([example](https://github.com/SecretDecks/Documentation/issues/149)).&#x20;

#### Automation!

Using GitHub actions, we will create a workflow that generates a contribution survey for each member on the last day of the month. This template will be generated from a YAML template and pre filled with the contributions done in the cooperatives Git repositories. This counts issues (tasks, epics, stories) assigned & closed; pull requests created, pull requests merged.&#x20;

Additionally, there will be another workflow (can be triggered by all core contributors) that will import clockify data into the contribution survey.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Other proposals or projects impacted**

**Other DAOs and DisCos can use this template and the GitHub actions to their liking.**

**üîç What is SecretDecks ?**

SecretDecks is a colourful collective of mindful spirits who work towards leaving this dimension a better place. Find out more about us on our "Arcana" GitBook at https://secretdecks.gitbook.io/arcana/introduction/who-and-what-is-secretdecks.

SecretDecks is building a Distributed Collective by discovering and exploring new tools for self organising communities. We share an agreed upon value system, defined in the Mindfulness Policy \[https://github.com/SecretDecks/Documentation/blob/main/Mindfulness-Policy.md] that sets the base vibration of our work.

The primary goal is to create a Tarot metaverse experience on web 3.0 architecture within a distributed cooperative and freely share the tools discovered and created to help other cooperatives grow and prosper.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Key metrics to measure**

1. **ROI** - An opensource template and Github action workflows for other DisCos and DAOs to do self reporting.
2. **Community participation** ‚Äì x amount of DisCos and DAOs will adopt the template and GitHub action workflows
3. **Proof of iteration** - Testing , feedback and documentation will inform the next iterations and Catalyst Community is engaged in after town hall breakout rooms
4. **Embracing failure** ‚Äì&#x20;

#### Leading KPIs

Publish documentation for each milestone (3) as playbook

Publish YAML template after each iteration (3) in GitHub&#x20;

Publish GitHub actions workflow after each iteration (2)

Publish all in a separate repository template (1)

#### Lagging KPIs

Playbook is shared on social media x amount of times / generated over 1k impressions on (twitter)?

YAML template is employed by two other Cardano/Catalyst projects

GH actions workflow is employed by two other Cardano/Catalyst projects

repository template is used x amount of times
