# Overview

**Problem statement**&#x20;

Rewarding intangible work in a DAO is not transparent or scalable. There is too much focus on $ allocation before contribution attribution.

**Describe your solution to the problem**

Develop an open-source attribution, valuation & reward system based on a Distributed Co-Op approach.
