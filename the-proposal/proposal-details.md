# Proposal Details

**Revisiting the Problem Statement**

One of the main reasons distributed organisations or cooperatives cannot transition to a sustainable reward system is the lack of a trusted & working mechanism to track, to attribute value and to successively reward contributions of individuals.

#### **An Experimental Solution**

To develop an open-source attribution, valuation & reward system - we are going to set up, configure and test a SourceCred instance in parallel with a contribution survey. We will also prepare guidance materials to onboard new users and document the results of the experiment.

SecretDecks will use

1. GitHub to track task items, to create written content, to maintain a wiki (Gitbook), to record ideas and meeting minutes.
2. Discord for informal and formal communication

#### **SourceCred instance**

We will setup a SourceCred instance to aggregate data from GitHub & Discord. SourceCred is a tool for communities to measure and reward value creation (https://sourcecred.io/).

Using SourceCred we will distribute "Can-D" (a community currency) according to the amount of positive or negative contributions or reactions each individual member has impacted within the community.

This proposal will trial how and for what "Can-D" can be exchanged or redeemed in the future.

#### **A parallel Contribution Survey**

In parallel to the SourceCred instance SecretDecks maintain a manual process for core members to attribute value to their work via a monthly "Contribution Survey" (Example : https://github.com/SecretDecks/Documentation/issues/43).

Each survey will be validated & reviewed by two other team members for final approval.

#### **Test runs**

SecretDecks will conduct test runs for 4 weeks over December 2021 and January 2021.

Core contributors will be rewarded first and the remaining ADA will be distributed evenly to everyone that has enough "Can-D".

### üìä **Milestones & Roadmap**

**Preparation - November 2021**

Prepare documentation - a GitBook chapter on "Distributed Work-Reward Mechanism"

Prepare a tutorial / educational content on the experiment.

Develop and deploy a tool template - refine contribution survey template

Configure SourceCred instance

#### **Test Runs - December 2021**

Test Case 1 - Week Beginning 6th December 2021

Test Case 2 - Week Beginning 13th December 2021

Test Case 3 - Week Beginning 3rd January 2022

Test Case 4 - Week Beginning 10th January 2022

**The launch date will be : 6th December 2021**

**The completion date will be : February 2022**

#### **Definition of success after 3, 6 and 12 months**

**3 Months - January 2022**

Final Report on experiment - will inform our configuration of source cred and process automation.

**6 Months - April 2022**

Completed weighted voting pilot - achieved self-funded status

**12 Months - October 2022**

&#x20;Able to deliver scalable solutions

### ‚Ç≥**Budget**

#### **Preparation**

Prepare documentation - 10 hours

Prepare a tutorial / educational content - 20 hours

Develop and deploy a tool template -10 hours

Configure SourceCred instance - 5 hours

SubTotal : 45 hours at $ 40 hour = $ 1800

#### **Test Runs**

Each test run will be resourced at 16 hours per week at $ 40 hour = $ 640

SubTotal : For 4 test cases - $ 2,560

#### **Final Report**

SubTotal : Final Report on experiment - 10 hours  at $ 40 hour = $ 400

**Total : 4,760**

### **üîç What is SecretDecks ?**

SecretDecks is a colourful collective of mindful spirits who work towards leaving this dimension a better place. Find out more about us on our "Arcana" GitBook at https://secretdecks.gitbook.io/arcana/introduction/who-and-what-is-secretdecks.

SecretDecks is building a Distributed Collective by discovering and exploring new tools for self organising communities. We share an agreed upon value system, defined in the Mindfulness Policy \[https://github.com/SecretDecks/Documentation/blob/main/Mindfulness-Policy.md] that sets the base vibration of our work.

The primary goal is goal is to create a Tarot metaverse on web 3.0 architecture within a distributed cooperative and freely share the tools discovered and created to help other cooperatives grow and prosper.

This pilot is driven within SecretDecks DisCo - DisCo stands for Distributed Collective.

### **Key metrics to measure**

1. **ROI** - Enable contribution tracking & test a SourceCred instance on GitHub and Discord.

&#x20;

1. **Community participation** ‚Äì 50 participants contributing to improving Catalyst decision making systems

&#x20;

1. **Proof of iteration** - SecretDecks has identified pain points through the running of a series of test cases.

&#x20;

1. **Embracing failure** ‚Äì SecretDecks  ill report on how well or how badly it performs.

&#x20;

**UPDATED KPIs (8th November)**

**Sentiment Analysis**

* Leading KPI: Create & Distribute 1 sentiment poll per month
* Lagging KPI: have SourCecred running and distribute Cred, take a sentiment vote on how much the community feels the distribution is fair; vote should be 75% (or more?) positive
* **Future** leading KPI: Create GitBook chapter with sentiment poll template

**Adoption**

* Leading KPI: setup 1 SC instances per month including onboarding workshop
* Lagging KPI: 1 organisation per month is adopting SC without asking for help after the workshop

**Tangible deliverables**

* Leading KPI: Documentation template; each month 33% of content is delivered: setup documentation for our case (tracking private channels), publish config, demo usage, update with tweaks
* Lagging KPI: adoption is increasing our support rate is decreasing (ratio)
