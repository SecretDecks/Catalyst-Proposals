#### The experimental approach of the Distributed Work Reward Mechanism project led to the following&#x20;

1. a new version of the Contribution Survey (design and funding happened in Q4 2021!)
2. another project (The HardForq) signalling interest in integrating [SourceCred](https://github.com/The-HardForq/SC-Instance) and the [Contribution survey](https://github.com/The-HardForq/Organisation)&#x20;
3. two rounds of remunerations and one round of community tips distributed
4. a detailed sentiment survey with three important takeaways (see below)

### KPI's

All done, except SourceCred setup on external project; see[ here for details & explanation.](progress-report/kpi-set-ii-ongoing.md#leading-kpi)

### Most important  takeaways:&#x20;

* overall sentiment was positive \~70% - would've been higher if data set was found &#x20;
* improve discover-ability of core contributor data sets
* define non financial rewards!
